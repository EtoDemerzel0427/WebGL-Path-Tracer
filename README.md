A WebGL-based path tracer that runs in your browser. All you need is a modern browser that supports WebGL2.0, you
can try it by opening `index.html` in your browser, or visit [here](https://huangweiran.club/WebGL-Path-Tracer).

# How to Run

Make sure you have `http-server` installed, otherwise you can install with `npm`:

```shell
npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can run with:

```shell
http-server .
```

Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to play with our web app.

Alternatively, you can run this http-server with python:

```shell
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then the web app is available at `localhost:8080` as well.
